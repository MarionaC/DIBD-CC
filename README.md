Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned pre-lab homework before each lab session.

## Cloud practical assignments
Students will begin by creating an essential toolbox to get them started in the Cloud. It will prepare them to be able to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. That will also allow students to be able to mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud or using new advanced analytics services available nowadays in the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these high-level analytics services in the Cloud, either regarding software or hardware, to understand how to meet high-performance requirements. The final goal is to provide code examples that smoothly can get the student started.
